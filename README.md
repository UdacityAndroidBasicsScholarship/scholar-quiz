## Disclaimer
> `This project is only for the students who participated in Udacity Scholarship Programme.`

## Breif Idea about Quiz App:
A ***Scholar Quiz*** app for All the Quiz Competation Conducted in Udacity Scholarship. 
</br>
Why It is Required ?
</br>
`Many students unable to get information on which channel and when the quizzes/challenge programs are being conducted. There are many and to remember all for when and on which channel are conducted is tough.`

### __Overview - :__
 
Here the students under the scholarship program can participate in quizzes that are being conducted by moderators or program monitor in an organized manner.
So we are here to give an equal chance to all scholar students irrespective of the timing.
User will be able to login using slack id or email Id. The user will then reach the main screen where they can see various channels based on regions or lessons in the program they have joined. When the user selects the channel or lesson they will be able to view a list of all the quizzes or challenges available in that channel. The user then can click on the quiz they wish to take by selecting that quiz from the list.

Moderator and scholar program handler will have access to add new quiz to the list. When a new quiz is inserted, subscriber will be notified through app.

### __Goal -:__
Existing system only allows the user to take quiz that is being prepared using google forms and requires the user to be available when the quiz is being scheduled. If the user misses the schedule or joined the program late he/she will miss the quiz. In the new system the moderator and scholar program handler will be able to add quiz to the list. When the quiz is added, subscriber will automatically get the notification in the app
